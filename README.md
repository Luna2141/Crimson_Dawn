# Crimson Project

This projects main focus is end user security and to help bridge the gap between web2.0 and web3.0 by offering a breath of fresh air and allowing on-Chain password management for your hot wallets and general use web2.0 accounts. 

# This is a WIP and is subject to change as development furthers

As stated, this project is a solo project and is subject to various changes as I see fit. However, I am also open to suggestions to features and feedback. If you wish to offer either, Please see the "Contact me" section to send in a suggestion or any feedback. 

Webpage is currently in the works which will offer a better description of the project and all that it plans to offer.
